# Common Shopping Types

This gem contains common protocol buffer types used by Google Shopping
related client libraries.

## Installation

This library is generally brought in as a dependency by Google API client
libraries that use it. However, you can include it directly in your
application's Gemfile if you need to use its protos directly.
